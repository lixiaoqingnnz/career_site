#### Brief introduction: 
AI Research Engineer – multimodal & knowledge-enhanced systems.

#### Responsibilities: 
- Built production-oriented Graph RAG pipelines (vector DB, chunking, embedding optimization, retrieval tuning), which improved retrieval accuracy and consistence, and enhanced structured reasoning for clinical knowledge bases. (Paper under review)
- Conducted research on generative AI models (diffusion models, GANs) for synthesizing medical and time-series data, with my proposed FHRDiff model achieving an overall 75.3% performance improvement over prior state-of-the-art methods. Paper published
- Developed an automated OCR pipeline for extracting blood pressure monitor readings, reducing manual transcription workload and significantly improving clinical data digitization efficiency.
- Utilized Weights & Biases for experiment tracking and model evaluation, improving reproducibility and reducing debugging/training iteration time.
- Curated and preprocessed multimodal datasets (text, image, signal, and knowledge-graph data), enabling cleaner data pipelines and reducing preprocessing effort for downstream ML/LLM workflows.
